# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where a set of vehicles must deliver goods or services to a set of customers in an optimal way. The goal is to minimize costs (e.g., distance, time, or fuel) while satisfying constraints like vehicle capacity, customer demands, and delivery windows.

VRP is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and is widely used in logistics, supply chain management, and transportation planning.


## ðŸšš Problem Definition

Given:

A fleet of vehicles stationed at a depot.
A set of customers with known locations and demands.
Constraints such as vehicle capacity.

The optimal set of routes for the vehicles to visit all customers while minimizing total travel cost.

## Run the application

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/georgeflour/MEDEBE.git
    ```


2. **Run Main.py**
   By running Main.py you will see 2 new files in you directory, solution.txt and 1.png.
   These files represent the routes and the total cost of our VRP

3. **Check the solution**
   You can check the solution by adding solution.txt to sol_checker.py
